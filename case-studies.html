                                 feel the Fasal’s system has been super helpful for me to prepare a precise irrigation schedule, earlier
                                 I used to irrigate my fields every 8 days for a duration of 8 hrs since the installation of Fasal’s system
                                 it started giving me timely alerts about the moisture levels in the fields, optimal irrigation advisory
                                 on which I acted upon timely leading to 40% less consumption of water.</p>

On the installation day, he was supposed to spray the fields according to his planned schedule but Fasal's alert system came in handy in predicting rainfall on that day which led to saving of his spray cost. The prediction of rainfall was perfect, Fasal’s device helped him prepare a precise irrigation schedule. Earlier he used to irrigate his fields every 4-5 days, post-installation he is irrigating after 7-8 days. Rameshji feels if all of the farmers in his neighbouring community install the device all of them would be collectively benefited from accurate prediction</p>

He has mainly benefited from three aspects with help of Fasal system on his vineyard. Firstly, Pest and disease alerts in the app before the outbreak has actually helped him to control the disease with the help of preventive sprays. Secondly, climatic forecast prediction alerts through are app which are farm-specific has helped him manipulate pruning and spray schedules. Thirdly, as over/under irrigation always hampers the quality of the crop, with the  help of timely alerts on irrigation through our app, has helped him not only in irrigating the crop optimally but also helped him save the water.</p>

                              <p class="for-molile-spacing-c">I've been cultivating grapes for the last 15 years. I've installed two Fasal devices covering an area of 5 acres. I feel the Fasal’s system has been super helpful for me to prepare a precise irrigation schedule, earlier I used to irrigate my fields every 8 days for a duration of 8 hrs since the installation of Fasal’s system it started giving me timely alerts about the moisture levels in the fields, optimal irrigation advisory on which I acted upon timely leading to 40% less consumption of water. Fasal’s system helped me in creating desirable micro-climatic conditions as it helped me in attaining ideal wapsa (‘Field Capacity’) levels in my fields. More importantly, it also alerted me regarding the downy mildew, powdery mildew, and anthracnose attacks and I immediately went for the preventive sprays. This video shoot is happening in my field only, and as you can observe the quality of grapes is excellent with good berry size, there has been a significant improvement in the quality and quantity of grapes production compared to last season, this has been possible because of the timely alerts & actionable insights which Fasal’s system provided me with. With its primary, secondary moisture sensors, temperature sensors, and weather forecast module Fasal system’s alerts and insights have been a constant mainstay of my irrigation & spray schedule planning. And I strongly feel if a farmer wants to boost his/her farm profitability then he/she should definitely go for Fasal’s system.</p>

On the installation day, he was supposed to spray the fields according to his planned schedule but Fasal's alert system came in handy in predicting rainfall on that day which led to saving of his spray cost. The prediction of rainfall was perfect, Fasal’s device helped him prepare a precise irrigation schedule. Earlier he used to irrigate his fields every 4-5 days, post-installation he is irrigating after 7-8 days. Rameshji feels if all of the farmers in his neighbouring community install the device all of them would be collectively benefited from accurate prediction</p>

Firstly, Pest and disease alerts in the app before the outbreak has actually helped him to control the disease with the help of preventive sprays. Secondly, climatic forecast prediction alerts through are app which are farm-specific has helped him manipulate pruning and spray schedules. Thirdly, as over/under irrigation always hampers the quality of the crop, with the help of timely alerts on irrigation through our app, has helped him not only in irrigating the crop optimally but also helped him save the water.</p>
